    <h2>THE REASON</h2>
        <p>The reason that I am interested in Computer Science is because I was to learn more about technology and know how computers work. </p>
    <h2>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2>
        <p>I learned how to make a website and how to use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github </a>. Also, I learned how number systems work and how to change between them. In addition, I gained a basic knowledge of logic and arduino.</p>

        <p>I want to improve my skill using some of the coding systems so that I can make something using them without any problem. Also I want to learn more about logic because it is a really interesting topic for me and I'm excited to discuss it more thoroughly. </p>
